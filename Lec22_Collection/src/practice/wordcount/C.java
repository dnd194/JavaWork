			"\r\n" + 
			"  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\r\n" + 
			"on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had\r\n" + 
			"peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no\r\n" + 
			"pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\r\n" + 
			"thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\r\n" + 
			"for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\r\n" + 
			"the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble\r\n" + 
			"of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\r\n" + 
			"Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice\r\n" + 
			"think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to\r\n" + 
			"itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\r\n" + 
			"it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\r\n" + 
			"wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\r\n" + 
			"but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\r\n" + 
			"POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\r\n" + 
			"her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\r\n" + 
			"before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\r\n" + 
			"take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\n" + 
			"field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\r\n" + 
			"down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\n" + 
			"considering how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\r\n" + 
			"and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\r\n" + 
			"moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\r\n" + 
			"falling down a very deep well.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\r\n" + 
			"had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\r\n" + 
			"wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\r\n" + 
			"down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\r\n" + 
			"see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\r\n" + 
			"noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\r\n" + 
			"here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\r\n" + 
			"took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\r\n" + 
			"labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\r\n" + 
			"was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\n" + 
			"somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\n" + 
			"fell past it.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\r\n" + 
			"shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\r\n" + 
			"all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\r\n" + 
			"even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\r\n" + 
			"true.)\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\r\n" + 
			"wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\r\n" + 
			"`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\r\n" + 
			"me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\n" + 
			"you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\n" + 
			"lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\r\n" + 
			"opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\r\n" + 
			"listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\r\n" + 
			"that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\r\n" + 
			"or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\r\n" + 
			"or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\r\n" + 
			"say.)\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\r\n" + 
			"THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\n" + 
			"people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\r\n" + 
			"think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\r\n" + 
			"time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\r\n" + 
			"have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\r\n" + 
			"Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\r\n" + 
			"to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\r\n" + 
			"through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\r\n" + 
			"an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\r\n" + 
			"never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\n" + 
			"began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\r\n" + 
			"should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\r\n" + 
			"her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\r\n" + 
			"down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\r\n" + 
			"you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\r\n" + 
			"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\r\n" + 
			"rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\r\n" + 
			"way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\r\n" + 
			"bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\n" + 
			"question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\r\n" + 
			"that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\r\n" + 
			"was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\r\n" + 
			"earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\r\n" + 
			"bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\n" + 
			"sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\n" + 
			"moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\r\n" + 
			"was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\r\n" + 
			"sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\n" + 
			"away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\n" + 
			"say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\n" + 
			"it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\r\n" + 
			"corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\r\n" + 
			"herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\n" + 
			"hanging from the roof.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\r\n" + 
			"and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\n" + 
			"other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\n" + 
			"wondering how she was ever to get out again.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\r\n" + 
			"solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\r\n" + 
			"and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\n" + 
			"doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\n" + 
			"the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\n" + 
			"them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\r\n" + 
			"curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\r\n" + 
			"door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\r\n" + 
			"in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\r\n" + 
			"passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\n" + 
			"looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\r\n" + 
			"How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\r\n" + 
			"among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\n" + 
			"she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\r\n" + 
			"my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\n" + 
			"very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\n" + 
			"I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\r\n" + 
			"know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\n" + 
			"had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\n" + 
			"things indeed were really impossible.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\r\n" + 
			"went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\r\n" + 
			"it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\n" + 
			"telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\n" + 
			"certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\n" + 
			"of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\r\n" + 
			"beautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\n" + 
			"Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\n" + 
			"first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\n" + 
			"for she had read several nice little histories about children who\r\n" + 
			"had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\n" + 
			"things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\n" + 
			"their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\n" + 
			"will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\r\n" + 
			"finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\r\n" + 
			"never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n" + 
			"`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\n" + 
			"later.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\n" + 
			"to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\n" + 
			"of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\r\n" + 
			"turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\n" + 
			"it off.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"         *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\r\n" + 
			"like a telescope.'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\r\n" + 
			"her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\r\n" + 
			"size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\r\n" + 
			"First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\r\n" + 
			"going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\r\n" + 
			"this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\r\n" + 
			"going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\r\n" + 
			"like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\r\n" + 
			"like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\r\n" + 
			"ever having seen such a thing.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\r\n" + 
			"on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\r\n" + 
			"when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\r\n" + 
			"little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\r\n" + 
			"she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\r\n" + 
			"quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\r\n" + 
			"up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\r\n" + 
			"and when she had tired herself out with trying,\r\n" + 
			"the poor little thing sat down and cried.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\r\n" + 
			"herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\r\n" + 
			"She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\r\n" + 
			"seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\r\n" + 
			"severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\r\n" + 
			"trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\r\n" + 
			"of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\r\n" + 
			"child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\r\n" + 
			"use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\r\n" + 
			"there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\r\n" + 
			"person!'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\r\n" + 
			"the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\r\n" + 
			"which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n" + 
			"`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\r\n" + 
			"I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\r\n" + 
			"under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\n" + 
			"don't care which happens!'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\r\n" + 
			"way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\n" + 
			"feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\r\n" + 
			"find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\r\n" + 
			"happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\r\n" + 
			"way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\r\n" + 
			"that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\r\n" + 
			"common way.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"         *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" +

			"\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" +

			"\r\n" + 
			"                           CHAPTER II\r\n" +

			"                        The Pool of Tears\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much\r\n" + 
			"surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good\r\n" + 
			"English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\n" + 
			"ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her\r\n" + 
			"feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so\r\n" + 
			"far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on\r\n" + 
			"your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't\r\n" + 
			"be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself\r\n" + 
			"about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\r\n" + 
			"kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\r\n" + 
			"way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of\r\n" + 
			"boots every Christmas.'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\r\n" + 
			"`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll\r\n" + 
			"seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the\r\n" + 
			"directions will look!\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\r\n" + 
			"                HEARTHRUG,\r\n" + 
			"                    NEAR THE FENDER,\r\n" + 
			"                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in\r\n" + 
			"fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took\r\n" + 
			"up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `I suppose so,' said Alice.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's\r\n" + 
			"angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm\r\n" + 
			"pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `Call it what you like,' said the Cat.  `Do you play croquet\r\n" + 
			"with the Queen to-day?'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been\r\n" + 
			"invited yet.'\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of\r\n" + 
			"hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how\r\n" + 
			"she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and\r\n" + 
			"loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about\r\n" + 
			"her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager\r\n" + 
			"with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of\r\n" + 
			"Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their\r\n" + 
			"simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\r\n" + 
			"remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\r\n" +
